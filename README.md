I needed an incubator to growth bacteria cultures as I conduct biological monitoring of the salmon stream in our neighborhood. Using a disposable Styrofoam cooler, an ESP8266 microcontroller, a couple of heating pads, temperature sensors, and a small DC fan, I built an Internet connected incubator what would maintain just the right termperature. If something goes wrong doing the incubator period, the cloud platform sends me an alert.
